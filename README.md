# The Peak Detector
## Find recurring peaks

The Peak Detector is a simple tool that gets impression/search data by vertical, country and month and sends back as an output all of the relevant verticals that have consistently peaked in the same month, for a given country.

The most common use case is for marketing folks to identify sub-seasonalities (e.g. it is obvious that retail peaks in December but many others are less known). 

## The peak detector is helpful for:
- marketeers who are either working on a different market 
- marketeers who are making their annual plan.
